# Enterprise-Authentication-SOC-Lab
End-to-end enterprise authentication monitoring lab using Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, and Splunk Enterprise to detect brute-force attempts, successful logins, PowerShell execution, network activity, and simulated lateral movement mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.




## Objective


This project demonstrates a real-world SOC detection workflow:

Validate log ingestion pipeline

Detect brute-force authentication attempts (Event ID 4625)

Detect successful authentication events (Event ID 4624)

Filter service-account noise

Parse Sysmon XML telemetry

Detect PowerShell execution (Sysmon Event ID 1)

Detect network connections (Sysmon Event ID 3)

Simulate lateral movement

Build threshold-based alert logic

Map detections to MITRE ATT&CK


## Stimulated Multi-Site SOC Architecture

This lab simulates an enterprise multi-site environment separating endpoint telemetry from SIEM infrastructure.

```
Site B (Endpoint – VirtualBox)
--------------------------------
Windows 10
+ Sysmon
+ Windows Security Logs
+ Splunk Universal Forwarder
        │
        │  (TCP 9997 – Forwarding Port)
        ▼
Site A (SIEM – VMware)
--------------------------------
Windows 11
+ Splunk Enterprise (Indexer + Search Head)
+ Detection Engineering
+ Alerting & Investigation
```


## Data Flow Explanation

Windows 10 (Site B) generates:

Security Event Logs

Sysmon telemetry

Splunk Universal Forwarder sends logs over TCP 9997

Splunk Enterprise (Site A) receives, indexes, and analyzes logs

SOC detections are built using SPL queries


## Detection Walkthrough

1️⃣ Failed Logon Detection (Brute Force)

Query: spl/failed_logon_4625.spl

Detects repeated failed login attempts.

MITRE: T1110 – Brute Force


2️⃣ Successful Login Detection

Query: spl/successful_logon_4624.spl

Validates successful authentication events.

MITRE: T1078 – Valid Accounts


3️⃣ Authentication Timeline Reconstruction

Query: spl/authentication_timeline.spl

Reconstructs authentication event sequence to identify attack progression.


4️⃣ Sysmon Telemetry Validation

Query: spl/sysmon_eventid_breakdown.spl

Validates enriched endpoint telemetry including:

Process creation

Network connections

File creation

Registry modifications


5️⃣ PowerShell Execution Detection

Query: spl/powershell_execution_detection.spl

Detects PowerShell process execution activity.

MITRE: T1059.001 – PowerShell


6️⃣ Network Connection Detection

Query: spl/network_connection_detection.spl

Detects outbound network activity from the endpoint.

MITRE: T1049 – System Network Connections Discovery


7️⃣ Lateral Movement Detection

Query: spl/lateral_movement_detection.spl

Detects remote logon activity (Logon Type 3 and 10).

MITRE: T1021 – Remote Services


8️⃣ Brute Force Alert Logic

Query: spl/brute_force_alert_threshold.spl

Triggers alert if failed login attempts exceed defined threshold within 5 minutes.


## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

| Behavior             | Technique |
| -------------------- | --------- |
| Brute Force          | T1110     |
| Valid Account Abuse  | T1078     |
| PowerShell Execution | T1059.001 |
| Network Discovery    | T1049     |
| Remote Services      | T1021     |



## SMB Brute Force Detection (Credential Access – T1110)
Attack Simulation (Kali Linux)

The attack was simulated from Kali Linux (10.0.0.44) targeting Windows 10 (10.0.0.231) over SMB (TCP 445).

Command Used (Successful)
```
for i in {1..5}; do smbclient -L //10.0.0.231 -U HACKE%WrongPass1!; done
```
This generated multiple failed SMB authentication attempts.

Confirmed:

Target reachable

SMB port open

Authentication failures logged


## Detection Query – Failed Logons
File: spl/failed_logon_4625.spl

```
index=main sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4625
| stats count by Account_Name, Source_Network_Address, Logon_Type
| sort -count
```
What It Shows

Failed authentication attempts

Attacker IP address

Logon type

Targeted account
